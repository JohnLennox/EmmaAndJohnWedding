            <p> As we start this exciting new chapter in our lives, the greatest gift we could ask for is your
                presence
                at
                our wedding, celebrating our love and the journey that lies ahead. Your support and love mean
                the world to
                us.</p>

            <p>We understand that some of you may wish to commemorate this occasion with a gift. While your
                presence is
                truly the only gift we need, if you do wish to celebrate our union in this way, we would
                gratefully
                appreciate a monetary contribution towards our future dreams and endeavors.</p>

            <p> Please know that your generosity and thoughtfulness, in whatever form it comes, are deeply
                appreciated and will always be remembered with fondness. </p>
